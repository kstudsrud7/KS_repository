# SharePoint Integration  

Power Pages integrates with **SharePoint via Dataverse**, allowing users to **view and manage documents** related to specific Dataverse records.  

## How It Works  
- **Enabled through Forms or Multistep Forms** within Power Pages.  
- Displays **only one document location** per Dataverse row (the first one created).  
- Requires integration with the **default SharePoint site** (custom sites are not supported).  

âœ… **Use Cases:**  
- Display **related documents dynamically** in a Power Pages site based on a Dataverse record.  
- Allow **external users** to upload/download files in a controlled environment.  
- Centralize document storage **without requiring duplication** in Dataverse.  

ðŸš¨ **Key Considerations:**  
- **Only works with the default SharePoint site**â€”custom site URLs are not supported.  
- **Supports only a single document location per record**â€”if multiple exist, it will use the first one created.  
- **Does not provide full SharePoint browsing capabilities**â€”it only shows files **linked to a specific Dataverse row**.
