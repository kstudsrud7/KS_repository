# Updates  

It is recommended to perform **updates in DEV environments** first to ensure stability and test any potential issues before applying to Production.  

## Solutions Updates  
- **Updates via Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC)** are the primary method for managing updates to Power Pages solutions.  
- **Test solutions in non-production environments** to confirm compatibility before updating in live environments.  

## Data Updates  
- **No automatic data updates** are applied; manual intervention is required if you wish to update data.  
- Make sure to back up important data before any manual updates.
