# Power BI Integration with Power Pages  

Power BI licensing is **separate** from Power Pages licensing. However, Power Pages can embed Power BI **dashboards and reports** in multiple ways depending on security and licensing requirements.  

## Power BI Visualization Options  

### 1. Publish to Web (Public Access)  
âœ… **When to Use:**  
- You want to **share reports publicly** with **no authentication required**.  
- The report contains **non-sensitive data** that can be viewed by anyone.  

ðŸš¨ **Considerations:**  
- **No security controls**â€”anyone with the link can access the report.  
- Not recommended for reports containing **confidential or business-sensitive data**.

### 2. Azure AD Authentication (Secure Access)  
âœ… **When to Use:**  
- The report should be **securely accessed** based on user authentication.  
- Used in **employee self-service portals** where employees see reports relevant to their organization.  

ðŸš¨ **Considerations:**  
- Requires **Power BI Pro or Premium** licensing.  
- Users must be **authenticated via Azure AD** to view the report in context of their security roles.

### 3. Power BI Embedded (External & Row-Level Security)  
âœ… **When to Use:**  
- **External users need access** to reports without requiring a Power BI Pro license.  
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** is needed to filter data per user.  
- You need to **filter reports** dynamically based on the currently logged-in contact in Power Pages.  
 
- Use **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to control what data each user can see.  
- **adx_identity_username** column on the **Contact** table is used to match logged-in users.  
- Use the **`USERNAME()`** DAX function in Power BI to filter data dynamically.  
- Requires **Power BI Embedded licensing** for external users.  

âš  **Important Setup Note:**  
- Use the **same Global Admin account** when setting up Power BI service, embedding configurations, and authentication settings.
