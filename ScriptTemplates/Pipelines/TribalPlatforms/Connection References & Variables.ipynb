    "For organizations that are using Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) to deploy and maintain their Power Platform solutions, connections can be especially tricky for many reasons, such as personnel turnover, different permissions in different environments, as well as many others. In this article, I hope to help you navigate these scenarios by providing you with a clear mental model for how connections work in an ALM solution. In this article, we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship between connectors, connections, and connection references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special considerations for service accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to declare and maintain connections and connection references across multiple Power Platform environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectors, connections, and connection references\n",
    "To understand how to manage connections across multiple Power Platform environments using ALM, it's necessary to first understand what connectors, connections, and connection references are, and how they are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connector: A built-in or custom component that surfaces some (or sometimes all) of a REST API's available endpoints, with information on what parameters can be provided, as well as what information will be returned. Example connectors include Dataverse, Office 365 Users, and SharePoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection: A set of credentials used to authenticate to a specific service. For example, if you create a Power Automate Flow and manually connect it to Dataverse, Power Platform stores information (such as an authentication token received from the API) so that you don't need to authenticate every time the Flow runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection reference: In Power Platform solutions (not applicable to Flows created outside of a solution), this component references a connection that exists within that environment. This is the key to managing connections in ALM, as it allows the same connection reference to point to a different connection in each environment. For example, you might have a connection reference called \"Dataverse connection reference\" that points to your personal connection in the Dev environment, but points to your service account's connection in the Test and Prod environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Service account considerations\n",
    "In a perfect world, we would all find our perfect team and no one would ever leave. In the real world, however, personnel turnover happens. This causes serious issues when the person leaving the team is using their credentials to connect to the various services that are used by the team's Flows and Apps. But the team still needs to securely connect to those services, so what are we supposed to do? One solution for this is \"service accounts\", which are actually just user accounts created in Microsoft Entra ID that aren't associated with a specific person. The benefit to using a service account instead of a standard user account is that, aside from regular password changes and any conditional access policies (such as requiring on-prem access) that are specific to service accounts, there is no action required when the team changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's great! So, we can just log in as the service account and connect each of our Flows and Apps to their respective connectors using this service account, right? Unfortunately, not. There's one other hidden step that must be completed in order for the connection references to use these connections - each connection created by a service account must be shared with the service principal (not to be confused with the service account) that is listed as the owner for the deployed Flows and Apps in that environment. We'll go over this in greater detail in the next section, but I felt it necessary to specifically call out this \"gotcha\" as it can lead to many difficult-to-debug issues.\n",

    "Create service account\n",
    "Since a service account is just a standard Microsoft Entra ID user account that isn't associated with a person (i.e., doesn't use MFA), the steps for creating one will be determined by your organization's Entra ID admins and are therefore likely to be different than the steps shown here.

    "Log into make.powerapps.com as the service account. Be sure to use separate browser window to avoid connection automatically using browser profile credentials. Update your password if prompted. If prompted to set up MFA, you can either dismiss it if you're just using it for this article or, if you plan on using this service account for production operations, discuss with your Entra ID admin for options to disable the MFA requirement for service accounts.\n",

    "Repeat for additional target environments and connections needed.\n",
    "Share connections\n",
    "Now that you've created the necessary connections in your target environment using your service account, you need to share this with the service principal that is used by your Azure DevOps pipeline to deploy the Power Platform solution into each environment. Here are the steps:\n",

    "ðŸ’¡\n",
    "You may be wondering why we created a deployment-settings folder and a folder for each environment, when we could have just named our JSON file to include the environment name and the solution name.

Not only have you created and shared your service account's connections, but you've gone through the tedious process of mapping those connections to the connection references used in your solution.

    "We add a DeploymentSettingsFile input and specified the location of our solution- and environment-specific deployment settings JSON file, so the Power Platform task knows which file to use.\n",
