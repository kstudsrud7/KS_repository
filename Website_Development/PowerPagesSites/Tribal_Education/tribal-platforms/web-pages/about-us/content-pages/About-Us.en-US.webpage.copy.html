      <p></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Culture is an important element within our Tribe’s community and bonds our spirituality in the hope for a better view of the world and morality. An example of our spirituality is the iconic symbol of the deer and the deer dancer whom mimics the connection to which our people have the nature. There is such a rich cultural identity, spiritual values with the merging of faiths and traditional practices both ceremonial and modern for the adaptation of preserving what truly makes us who we are.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">We are a federally recognized Indian tribe whose members have lived for generations on the&nbsp;Reservation and throughout east central Arizona.

      <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: left;">“American Indian nations have been recognized as sovereigns since before the formation of the United States. Our Tribe, a federally recognized Indian tribe, has a rich history and culture that dates back to a time before Arizona became a state. As the Tribe’s democratically elected Chief Executive, and on behalf of our more than 3,000 member citizens, I take great pride in presenting the story of our long and proud history.&nbsp;In the mid-1700s, the ancestors of today’s Tribe settled near east central Arizona and established a way of life that the Tribe&nbsp;continues to preserve. The original members hunted, fished, gathered vegetation, and taught their children a profound respect for nature. They endured hardship and poverty in the face of pressures from the non-Indian culture, but they worked hard and dreamed of a better future.”</p>
